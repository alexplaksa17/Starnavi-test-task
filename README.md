# Starnavi-test-task
Test task for the vacancy Starnavi frontend developer 

In this app I use React route to navigate between home and form pages and redux-thunk for side effects

How to run it:
<li>copy git repo</li>
<li>go to projet folder</li>
<li>in console run <pre>npm install</pre> <pre>npm run dev</pre></li>


I may modify app and add new features in short time

If you have questions feel free to contact me
