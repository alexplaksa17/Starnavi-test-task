# Starnavi-test-task
Test task for the vacancy Starnavi frontend developer 

In this app I use React route to navigate between home and form pages and redux-thunk for side effects.
All changes with data in form are dispatched to redux store, so it is easy to add ability to send to server submitted user changes in form (however, test task has no info about it) 

How to run it:
<li>copy git repo</li>
<li>go to projet folder</li>
<li>in console run <pre>npm install</pre> <pre>npm run dev</pre></li>


I may modify app and add new features in short time
